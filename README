iControl

This package provides a Perl interface to the F5 iControl API.

The F5 iControl API is an open SOAP/XML for communicating with supported F5 
BIGIP products.

The primary aim of this package is to provide a simplified interface to an 
already simple and intutive API and to allow the user to do more with less 
code.  By reducing the API invocations to methods returning simple types,it is 
hoped that this module will provide a simple alternative for common tasks.

The secondary aim for this package is to provide a simple interface for 
accessing statistical data from the iControl API for monitoring, recording, 
archival and display in other systems.  This objective has largely been 
obsoleted in v11 with the introduction of new statistical monitoring and 
display features in the web UI.

This package generally provides two methods for each each task; a raw method 
typically returning the response as received from iControl and a "stringified"
method returning a parsed response.

In general, the stringified methods will typically fufill most requirements 
and should usually be easier to use.
